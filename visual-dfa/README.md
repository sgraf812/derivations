# `visual-dfa`

This is a [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) derivation for building my fork of [ppati000/visualDFA](https://github.com/sgraf812/visualDFA).

Make sure you have Nix installed (and sourced your Nix profile at `~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`), then just execute `nix-build` in this folder.
This will download all the necessary tools to build and it and produce an executable `result/bin/visual-dfa`, which you can run.

For instructions on how to use visualDFA, visit the [original repository](https://github.com/ppati000/visualDFA).
